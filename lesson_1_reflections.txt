How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
-It allowed me to saved time that would be wasted looking and comparing
at lines individually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
-By the time saved and the fewer space required to save copies on my hard drive

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-Manually saving allows to create more logical commits and makes it easier to go
back and interpret the message in each commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-In git it is usual to  be working on files that depend on each other, this is
called a repository. In Google Docs, for example files are not dependent on each
other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-git log allows to view the complete history of commits with information from
each (id, date, message)
git diff, takes in a first and a second commit id's in order to compare the
changes made from one to another.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
-I would feel confident that I can always go back to a previous working session.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
-I want to remember which was my previous bash_profile setup
