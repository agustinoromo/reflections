When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
-When looking to work collaboratively, working on different computers or as
another repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-Updating automatically might pull changes that are from previous commits. The
working copy might have unfinished features that are not ready to show to the
world.
