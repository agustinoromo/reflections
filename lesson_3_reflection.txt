When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
-When looking to work collaboratively, working on different computers or as
another repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-Updating automatically might pull changes that are from previous commits. The
working copy might have unfinished features that are not ready to show to the
world.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
- Fork: is a clone of the repository inside the Github ecosystem and server. It allows
to make commits in your own copy of the repository without authorization of the
owner.
Clone: Downloads the repository in the working directory with the .git file
that stores all commits made up to this point. Generates a local copy in the user
computer.
Branch: Creates a separate track from the master in git. Allows to experiment
without compromising the main body of work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
-To being able to make comparison with the remote without an internet access,
also to see its commit history with git log as well as using git diff
