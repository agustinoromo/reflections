What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-A hidden file with .git extension gets created. It is necessary to start
tracking file changes

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
-It works as a way to pre-commit files, sort of an intermediate place for the
repository and the working copy. It allows the developer to build up their
commits however they want.
